# Git demo project

Demo project for the Git course. This will be great!

## Reminder of Git basic commands

* `git init`: create a new repo from scratch.
* `git clone <https://...>`: clone an existing repository.
* `git add <file or directory>`: stage files (add files to the Git index).
* `git commit -m "commit message"`: create a new commit.
* `git push`: push commits to existing repository

This line was added from the cloned repo.
